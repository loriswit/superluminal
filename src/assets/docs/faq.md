## What is the best version of the game for speedruns?

For **glitchless** speedruns, simply play the **latest version** available.

For **any% / legacy warpless**, you want to [downpatch](/resources) to the oldest version (**1.0.2019.11.12**) to be
able to trigger every glitch.

## Do I need to submit a video to be accepted in the leaderboard?

Yes, you must submit a video of your full run with audible **game sound** (background music/noise is fine). If you play
on a version that **has** an option to enable the in-game timer, it **must be visible** on your video. Alternatively,
you can display LiveSplit (with **auto-splitting enabled**) instead of the in-game timer.

## Why does LiveSplit not pause during loading screens?

Your LiveSplit timer may be displaying the real time. Right-click on LiveSplit → compare against → game time.
Make sure **not** to click the "individual level" checkbox in the settings.

## How do I install the practice mod?

Check pinned messages in [#general](https://discord.gg/T6JbGSG) and/or watch this [video](https://youtu.be/AAnAx-_y-vk).

## How do I downpatch the game?

First, open Steam, right-click Superliminal, click "properties", go to "betas" and select "version 1.0". This will
actually install version 1.10.2020.11.4, which is not the earliest one. You can **then** install
the [downpatch](/resources).

## Why is my run not verified yet? How long will it take?

Speedrun.com's requirement on run verification is two weeks from submission (recently it has been three weeks, due to
COVID-19). However, on average, we tend to get runs done by **four days or sooner**.
